## Updating (Once Installed)

In your terminal at the root of your local POGPT Suite repository, run:

```bash
npm run update
```

## Initial Build Guide (Linux Only)

Follow these steps to get your own POGPT Suite instance running locally.

### 1. Clone this GitHub Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chair4ce/POGPTSuite.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Open a terminal in the root directory of your local POGPT Suite repository and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Install Supabase

#### 1. Install Docker

Docker is required to install Supabase. If it is not installed already, visit [their documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) to install the version for your distribution.

#### 2. Add your user account to the local docker user group.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

You may need to log out and back into your account for the permissions to apply.

#### 3. Install Supabase CLI

Homebrew is required to install Supabase. If it is not installed already, run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once Homebrew is installed, run:

```bash
brew install supabase/tap/supabase
```

#### 4. Start Supabase

In your terminal at the root of your local POGPT Suite repository, run:

```bash
supabase start
```

### 5. Fill in Secrets

#### 1. Environment Variables

In your terminal at the root of your local POGPT Suite repository, run:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Get the required values by running:

```bash
supabase status
```

Note: Use `API URL` from `supabase status` for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`.

Now go to your `.env.local` file and fill in the values.

If the environment variable is set, it will disable the input in the user settings.

#### 2. SQL Setup

In the 1st migration file, `supabase/migrations/20240108234540_setup.sql`, you will need to replace 2 values with the values you got above:

- `project_url` (line 53): `http://supabase_kong_chatbotui:8000` (default) can remain unchanged if you don't change your `project_id` in the `config.toml` file
- `service_role_key` (line 54): You got this value from running `supabase status`

### 6. Install Ollama

#### 1. Compute Selection

##### CPU Only (No GPU)

If the system does not have access to an Nvidia GPU, run:

```bash
docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
```

##### Nvidia GPU (Non-AMD)

If the system does have access to an Nvidia GPU, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) to install the Nvidia Container Toolkit for your distribution.

Once the toolkit is installed, run:

```bash
docker run -d --gpus=all -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
```

#### 2. Choose LLM Model

Visit the [Ollama library](https://ollama.ai/library) and choose a model from the list.

Run the model of your choice at least once. Here is an example using Llama 2:

```bash
docker exec -it ollama ollama run llama2
```

Once running, type `/bye` to exit.

### 7. Run app locally

In your terminal at the root of your local POGPT Suite repository, run:

```bash
npm run chat
```

Your local instance of POGPT Suite should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Be sure to use a compatible node version (i.e. v18).

You can view your backend GUI at [http://localhost:54323/project/default/editor](http://localhost:54323/project/default/editor).
